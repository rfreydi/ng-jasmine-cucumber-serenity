# NG Jasmine Cucumber Serenity

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

The aim is to provide an environment where Jasmine/Cucumber/Serenity are built side by side.

All tests are based on [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/), even [Serenity](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/) which have it own protractor library.

## Running Jasmine end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io).

## Running Cucumber end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2c` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io).

## Running Serenity end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2s` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Serenity](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/).

## Further help

The base of the testing has been inspired by [Testing Angular apps with Protractor & Cucumber](https://carrieforde.com/angular-testing-with-protractor-cucumber/).

The Serenity part was inspired by [Serenity/JS Examples](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/master/examples) and adapted to the previous testing.
